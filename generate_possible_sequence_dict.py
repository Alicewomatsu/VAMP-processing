This module contains two functions which generate dictionaries where each possible
sequence for a given library is a key.

generate_randomized_sequence_dict is for site-saturation libraries. It generates all
possible sequences, assuming N at all randomized positions.

generate_twist_sequence_dict is for oligo pool libraries. It reads the randomized base
sequences from the sequence names in the Twist oligo pool .csv file.

Both functions return a dictionary of sequences and counts:
{sequence: [0, 0, 0...]}
